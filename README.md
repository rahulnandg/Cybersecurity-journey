# Cybersecurity Journey

Hi! I'm Rahul, an aspiring cybersecurity analyst currently focused on learning Linux, Blue Team skills, and practical hacking labs.

This repo is my public learning log, documenting everything I've done — from terminal-based war games to TryHackMe rooms. It shows what I’ve learned, how I solved things, and what tools I’m getting comfortable with.
