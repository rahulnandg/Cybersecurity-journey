# 📦 Packets and Frames - TryHackMe

## 🧭 Module Completed: Packets and Frames  
**Platform**: [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)  
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Badge Earned**: Yes  
**Learning Focus**: Deepening network fundamentals by understanding data encapsulation, packet/frame structures, and protocol behavior.

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🔹 1. What Are Packets and Frames?
- Understood how data is **broken down into packets** to be transmitted over networks.
- Learned the difference between:
  - **Packets** (Network Layer – contain IP headers)
  - **Frames** (Data Link Layer – contain MAC headers)
- Grasped the concept of **encapsulation** — wrapping data in multiple headers as it travels down the OSI stack.

### 🔹 2. TCP/IP Protocol Stack & Three-Way Handshake
- Studied how the **TCP/IP model** aligns with the OSI model.
- Learned about:
  - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** for reliable, connection-based communication
  - **Three-Way Handshake** (SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK)
  - Sequence numbers, acknowledgments, and flow control
- Understood how **TCP ensures delivery**, making it ideal for sensitive data.

### 🔹 3. UDP/IP Protocol
- Explored **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** — a fast, connectionless protocol used where speed is more important than reliability (e.g., video streaming, DNS).
- Compared TCP vs UDP and identified use cases for both.

## 💡 Why This Module Matters

Understanding packets, frames, and transport protocols is **foundational for network defenders**. Whether I’m analyzing logs, inspecting packets, or detecting anomalies — I now understand **how data actually moves across networks**.

This module sharpened my ability to:
- Recognize normal vs suspicious traffic
- Understand how attackers might exploit TCP/UDP behavior
- Build stronger skills for packet analysis and intrusion detection

## 🧠 Practical Relevance for Cybersecurity Roles

✅ As a future **SOC Analyst** or **Blue Teamer**, I’ll be:
- Working with tools like **Wireshark**, **Zeek**, and **Suricata**
- Analyzing traffic flow at the **packet/frame level**
- Investigating how malware or attackers move laterally or exfiltrate data

This module gave me a strong base to handle those responsibilities confidently.

## 🤝 Let’s Connect

I'm actively preparing for **entry-level roles in cybersecurity** and would love to join a team where I can contribute while learning hands-on.
