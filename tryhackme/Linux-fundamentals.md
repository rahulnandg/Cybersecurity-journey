# 🐧 Linux Fundamentals Series – TryHackMe

Welcome to my documentation of the **Linux Fundamentals** series on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), where I completed all three parts of the room and gained strong foundational knowledge in Linux from a cybersecurity and system operations perspective.

> 🔐 **Goal**: To strengthen my command-line fluency, understand the Linux file system, and learn how to operate like a true Linux user in real-world cybersecurity labs.

## ✅ What I Learned

### 📁 1. Interacting with File Systems
- Navigating directories with `cd`, `pwd`, and `ls`
- Creating, moving, and deleting files using `touch`, `mkdir`, `rm`, and `mv`
- Viewing file contents with `cat`, `less`, `head`, and `tail`
- Understanding absolute vs relative paths

### 🔍 2. Searching for Files
- Using `find` to locate files and directories by name, type, and more
- Mastering `grep` to search inside file contents (pattern matching, case-insensitive search, recursive search)
- Combining commands with `|` (pipe) for powerful filtering

### 💻 3. Introduction to Shell Operators
- Using redirection operators like `>`, `>>`, and `<`
- Piping with `|`
- Chaining commands with `&&` and `||`
- Command substitution with backticks and `$()`

### 🔐 4. Accessing Machines using SSH
- Understanding SSH protocol for remote access
- Connecting to remote machines securely via `ssh user@ip`
- Using `.pem` key files for authentication
- Port forwarding basics

### 🏁 5. Flags and Switches
- Using `--help` and `man` to explore command options
- Understanding the purpose of flags (e.g. `-l`, `-a`, `-R`)
- Enhancing command efficiency with multiple combined flags

### 🛡️ 6. Linux File Permissions 101
- Understanding users, groups, and others
- Reading file permissions in `ls -l` output
- Modifying permissions using `chmod` (symbolic and numeric)
- Changing ownership with `chown` and `chgrp`

### 📂 7. Common Directories in Linux
- Understanding key directories:  
  `/home`, `/etc`, `/bin`, `/usr`, `/var`, `/opt`, `/root`
- Purpose of each directory in system architecture
- Navigating and interpreting logs in `/var/log/`
