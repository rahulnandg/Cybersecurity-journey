# 🌐 HTTP in Detail – TryHackMe Course Completion

Welcome! This repo documents what I learned from completing the **"HTTP in Detail"** course on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), a hands-on cybersecurity learning platform.

This course helped me deeply understand how the web works at the protocol level — knowledge that’s essential for web developers, security professionals, and penetration testers.

## ✅ Topics I Learned

### 📌 1. What is HTTP?
- HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the web.
- It works in a **request-response** model between clients (browsers) and servers.

### 📌 2. HTTP Request & Response
- Structure of HTTP requests (method, URL, headers, body)
- Structure of HTTP responses (status code, headers, body)
- How browsers and tools like `curl` communicate with servers

### 📌 3. HTTP Methods
- `GET`: Request data
- `POST`: Submit data
- `PUT`: Update existing data
- `DELETE`: Remove data
- `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `PATCH`, and others

### 📌 4. HTTP Status Codes
- Informational: 100–199
- Success: 200–299 (e.g. 200 OK, 201 Created)
- Redirection: 300–399 (e.g. 301 Moved Permanently)
- Client Errors: 400–499 (e.g. 404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden)
- Server Errors: 500–599 (e.g. 500 Internal Server Error)

### 📌 5. HTTP Headers
- Request headers like `Host`, `User-Agent`, `Accept`, `Cookie`
- Response headers like `Content-Type`, `Set-Cookie`, `Cache-Control`

### 📌 6. Cookies
- Small pieces of data stored in the browser
- Used to maintain sessions and user preferences
- HTTP is **stateless**, so cookies are crucial for remembering users

### 📌 7. Making HTTP Requests
- Using `curl` to send custom HTTP requests
- Observing headers, status codes, and response bodies
- Analyzing web traffic to understand how websites communicate

## 🛠️ Tools I Used
- TryHackMe virtual machines and web labs
- Web browser dev tools (Network tab)
- `curl` and `Postman` for manual HTTP requests
- Burp Suite (intro level) to intercept and analyze traffic

## 📁 Why This Matters

Understanding HTTP is the **foundation for web development, debugging, and cybersecurity**. Whether you’re writing secure applications or testing them for vulnerabilities, this knowledge is essential.

This course sets the stage for diving deeper into:
- Web application hacking
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Secure web development
- Network traffic analysis

## 🚀 What’s Next?
- I’m actively learning about Web Security, Burp Suite, and the OWASP Top 10.
- You can find all my learning progress documented across multiple TryHackMe rooms in this GitHub profile.
- I’m open to cybersecurity internships, entry-level roles, and collaborations.
