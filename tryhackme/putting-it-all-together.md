## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🌐 Load Balancers
- Learned how load balancers distribute incoming web traffic across multiple servers.
- Prevents overload, ensures uptime, and increases availability.
- Essential for high-availability systems and DDoS protection.

---

### 🌍 Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
- CDNs cache static content (images, CSS, JS) at edge locations around the world.
- Improve speed, reduce latency, and lower the load on origin servers.
- Act as a first layer of defense by filtering malicious traffic.

---

### 🧱 Databases
- Understood how websites use databases to store and retrieve user data.
- Covered types of databases: SQL (e.g., MySQL) vs NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB).
- Learned how poor database security can lead to attacks like SQL injection.
- Emphasis on encrypting data and applying the principle of least privilege.

---

### 🛡️ Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)
- Learned how WAFs monitor and filter HTTP traffic to and from a web app.
- Protect against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities like XSS, SQLi, file inclusion, etc.
- Can be rule-based or cloud-managed.
- Important for defense-in-depth and layered security.

---

### 🖥️ Web Servers
- Understood the role of web servers (like Apache or Nginx) in handling HTTP requests.
- Serve static content and route dynamic requests to application backends.
- Configuration plays a huge role in performance and security.

---

### 🏷️ Virtual Hosts
- Learned how a single web server can host multiple websites/domains using virtual hosts.
- Important for shared hosting and infrastructure efficiency.
- Misconfigured virtual hosts can lead to exposure or privilege escalation.

---

### 🧾 Static vs Dynamic Content
- Static content = Fixed files (e.g., HTML, CSS, images).
- Dynamic content = Generated at runtime (e.g., user dashboards, search results).
- Dynamic content often involves databases and user input, making it more vulnerable to attacks.
- Security measures must differ depending on content type.

## 🔐 Why This Room Matters

This room helped me understand how real-world web infrastructure is built, deployed, and secured. I now have hands-on knowledge of:

- How traffic is handled at scale
- How sensitive data flows through a system
- Where vulnerabilities can appear at different layers
- How to mitigate threats with proper tools and architecture

It bridged the gap between basic web concepts and practical, real-world cybersecurity skills.
