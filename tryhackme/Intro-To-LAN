## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🔹 1. LAN Topologies
- Explored common LAN designs including **Star**, **Bus**, and **Ring** topologies.
- Understood how devices are physically and logically connected within small to medium-sized networks.

### 🔹 2. Subnetting
- Practiced dividing large networks into **smaller, manageable sub-networks**.
- Learned how **IP addressing and subnet masks** work together to improve efficiency and security.
- Gained confidence calculating subnets using CIDR notation.

### 🔹 3. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- Understood how ARP translates IP addresses into **MAC addresses** to enable device communication on a LAN.
- Practiced ARP lookups and saw real-world use cases in traffic analysis and troubleshooting.

### 🔹 4. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- Learned how devices dynamically receive **IP addresses, gateways, and DNS settings**.
- Understood the full **DHCP lease process**: Discover → Offer → Request → Acknowledge (DORA).
