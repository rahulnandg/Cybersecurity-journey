# 🧱 OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection) - TryHackMe

## 🧭 Module Completed: OSI Model  
**Platform**: [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)  
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Badge Earned**: Yes  
**Learning Focus**: Understanding the OSI 7-layer model, data flow through networks, and applying knowledge in a practical game-based scenario.

## 📚 What is the OSI Model?

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model** is a conceptual framework that standardizes how data travels from one device to another across a network.  
It divides networking functions into **7 distinct layers**, helping cybersecurity professionals **troubleshoot and analyze** communication protocols efficiently.

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🟦 Layer 1: Physical
- Deals with **hardware and transmission media** (cables, signals, voltages)

### 🟩 Layer 2: Data Link
- Responsible for **MAC addresses**, switches, and **error detection**

### 🟥 Layer 3: Network
- Focuses on **routing** and **IP addressing** (IP, routers, packets)

### 🟨 Layer 4: Transport
- Handles **reliable data transfer**, segmentation, **TCP/UDP**

### 🟪 Layer 5: Session
- Manages **sessions** and **connections** between devices

### 🟧 Layer 6: Presentation
- Responsible for **encryption, compression, and formatting**

### 🟫 Layer 7: Application
- The layer end-users interact with (e.g., **HTTP, FTP, DNS**)

## 🕹️ OSI Dungeon Game (Gamified Learning)

To reinforce my understanding, I completed a fun, interactive **OSI Dungeon Game** that challenged me to:
- Climb the dungeon by entering the tunnels in the appropriate 7 layers. 


This game cemented my theoretical knowledge with **practical reasoning and pattern recognition** — a valuable skill in both blue team operations and incident response.

## 💡 Why This Module Matters

A solid understanding of the OSI model is **fundamental for troubleshooting, packet analysis, and threat detection**.  
Whether you’re monitoring a network, investigating a breach, or configuring firewalls — knowing where data flows and where issues occur is key.

This module enhanced my ability to:
- Think like a **network defender**
- Analyze issues layer-by-layer
- Map cybersecurity tools and attacks to the OSI stack

## 📌 Summary for Recruiters

As an aspiring **SOC Analyst** and **Blue Team member**, I’m building my skills from the ground up.  
This OSI Model training added strong value to my foundation and analytical thinking — making me better equipped to:
- Detect anomalies
- Understand protocol behavior
- Communicate clearly during incident response
