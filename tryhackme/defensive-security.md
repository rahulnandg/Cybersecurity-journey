## 🎯 What is Defensive Security?

Defensive Security refers to all practices, tools, and strategies designed to **monitor, detect, and protect systems from cyber threats**. It focuses on **proactive and reactive measures** to secure digital environments.

In contrast to offensive security (which focuses on finding and exploiting vulnerabilities), **defensive security professionals build, monitor, and harden systems**.

## 🧠 Key Areas Covered

### 🔹 1. **Security Operations Center (SOC)**
- Role of SOC in defending against threats
- Analyst tiers (L1, L2, L3) and escalation process

### 🔹 2. **Monitoring & Detection**
- SIEM tools like Splunk and Elastic
- Log analysis and real-time alerting

### 🔹 3. **Incident Response**
- The IR lifecycle: Preparation, Detection, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned

### 🔹 4. **Digital Forensics**
- Investigating logs and disk images
- Preserving and analyzing evidence for root cause analysis

### 🔹 5. **Threat Intelligence**
- Gathering data from IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)
- Using CTI platforms to stay ahead of attackers

## 🛠️ Practical Example: Real-World SOC Scenario

> 🔍 Simulated detecting suspicious activity using a SIEM tool.  
> 🧾 Investigated logs for unusual login attempts across multiple endpoints.  
> 🚨 Escalated a brute-force detection alert to Tier 2 using threat intelligence indicators.  
> 📁 Collected evidence for incident response and documented actions for the post-mortem report.

This hands-on simulation gave me a **real taste of working in a SOC environment** — analyzing logs, detecting anomalies, and taking appropriate action.

## 📌 Why This Matters

This module sharpened my skills in real-world detection, monitoring, and escalation workflows — key skills for any **SOC Analyst** or **Defensive Security** role.

---

## 🔍 Looking Ahead

I'm actively:
- Expanding my skills via **TryHackMe**, **Practical Labs**, and **CTFs**
- Preparing for **SOC Analyst roles** and **cybersecurity internships**
- Eager to contribute and learn in a real-world security team
