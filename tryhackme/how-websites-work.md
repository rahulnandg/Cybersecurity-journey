## 🔍 What I Learned

### 🧱 1. HTML – Structure of the Web
- Understood how HTML forms the **building blocks of a web page**.
- Explored HTML elements like:
  - `<form>`, `<input>`, `<script>`, `<div>`, etc.
- Learned how user input is captured and processed on websites.
- Discovered how poorly secured HTML forms can lead to vulnerabilities.

---

### 📜 2. JavaScript – The Web's Logic
- Learned how JavaScript **adds interactivity and behavior** to web pages.
- Understood how JS can be misused by attackers for **client-side attacks**.
- Learned about `document.cookie`, `localStorage`, and how data can be manipulated on the front end.
- Gained a basic understanding of how JavaScript is essential for **both functionality and attack vectors** in web security.

---

### 🔐 3. Sensitive Data Exposure
- Understood the concept of **data at rest and data in transit**.
- Explored how **unsecured login forms, exposed credentials, or misconfigured sites** can lead to data leaks.
- Learned about **HTTPS**, encryption, and importance of **not exposing sensitive info in HTML/JS**.

---

### 🛡️ 4. HTML Injection – Attacking the DOM
- Practiced crafting **malicious HTML payloads** to manipulate web pages.
- Learned how attackers can:
  - Inject arbitrary HTML content into a site.
  - Alter or deface the DOM.
  - Trick users into clicking links or submitting forms.
- Understood the difference between **HTML Injection** and **XSS**, and how both affect security.

---

## 💡 Why This Matters
This room gave me strong foundational knowledge of:
- How websites function under the hood.
- How user input flows through the web stack.
- Common security flaws in poorly built websites.
- How attackers exploit these flaws — and how developers and security engineers can prevent them.
