# ðŸŽ¯ Bandit Level 0 - OverTheWire Completed

Today, I completed **Bandit Level 0** from [OverTheWireâ€™s Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/), a series of Linux-based cybersecurity challenges designed to sharpen practical system-level hacking skills. This marks the beginning of my hands-on journey into offensive security and Linux fundamentals.

**Goal** 
Find the hidden password in a file called readme.

To complete Level 0, I followed these steps:

1. **SSH into the Bandit Server**  
   I used the following command to remotely connect to the Bandit wargame server:
   ```bash
   ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
2. **Enter password**
   Every level requires a unique password to enter the level, in this case the password it bandit0.
   
3. **Listing**
   I list all the files in the home directory by typing **"ls"**.

4. **Read the file**
    I then read the file by entering **"cat readme"**.

 Skills Demonstrated
 Secure remote login using SSH

 Navigating and interacting with a Linux terminal

 Using essential commands like ls and cat

 Taking initiative to learn through hands-on security labs

If you're hiring for a role in cybersecurity, DevSecOps, or development with a security focus, Iâ€™d love to connect. Iâ€™m passionate about creating secure, well-architected software and continuously growing as a technical problem-solver.

ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Next
Continuing to Bandit Level 1 and documenting progress at each stage

Deepening my understanding of Linux command-line tools and shell scripting

Exploring real-world applications of these skills in offensive and defensive security
